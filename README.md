- transporter create

  `generate` creates a migration inside the `db/migrations` folder.

#### Migrations

Migrations are simple `.go` files generated by transporter, these define a struct that implements 2 functions `Up_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX()` and `Down_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX()` which will be called according to the command you're calling from the CLI.

This is an example of a transporter Migration.

```go
package migrations
import "github.com/wawandco/transporter/transporter"

func init(){
  transporter.Register(&Migration{
    Up:         Up_20151119112619,
    Down:       Down_20151119112619,
    Identifier: 20151119112619,
  })
}

func Up_20151119112619(txn *transporter.Tx) {
  //Here you run your logic for the migration.
}

func Down_20151119112619(txn *transporter.Tx) {
  //Here you run your logic to rollback the migration.
