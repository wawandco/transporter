Transporter is a database migration tool (CLI), it helps you keep your databases in order by creating migration files, those migration files are Go files that run SQL commands on your database to keep multiple environments databases in sync on its structure.

#### Installation

To install Transporter please run `go get -u github.com/wawandco/transporter`, with that, the transporter command should be available.

#### Supported DBMS

Transporter supports the following DBMS's

- postgresql
- mysql [comming soon]

#### Commands

- transporter init

  `init` checks for `db` folder and creates this one and the `migrations` folder inside if these doesn't exist, also generates a `config.yml` file inside `db`.

- transporter create

  `generate` creates a migration inside the `db/migrations` folder.

- transporter up

  `up` runs all pending migrations inside the `db/migrations` folder.

- transporter down

  `down` runs last migration down.

#### Migrations

Migrations are simple `.go` files generated by transporter, these define a struct that implements 2 functions `Up` and `Down` which will be called according to the command you're calling from the CLI.

This is an example of a transporter Migration.

```go
package migrations
import "github.com/wawandco/transporter/transporter"

func init(){
  transporter.Register(&Migration{
    Identifier: 20151119112619,
    Up:         func (txn *sql.Tx) {
      txn.Exec("ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN new_column varchar(255);")
    },
    Down:       func (txn *sql.Tx) {
      txn.Exec("ALTER TABLE my_table DROP COLUMN new_column;")
    },
  })
}
```


#### Migrating your Heroku Database [TODO]

Transporter supports you to add the DATABASE_URL environment variable, if you do, it will take the database connection url from there, otherwise it will take it from your `db/config.yml` file.

If you need to run your migrations against your heroku database you could simply run:

```sh
$ DATABASE_URL=[YOUR_DATABASE_URL] transporter up
```

And Transporter will run against your heroku database instead of your development one.
